You could see two processes:
1)FireBase
2)FireBaseWithSchema

To run FireBase , you need to provide the name and text as input and there is no schema used in the file.
Global variable have been used for URI .So you can directly begin adding the text and name as input to the starter activity. 


You can run FireBaseWithSchema but data wont be available on the chat. But you can view that data in the Forge available at the

Thanks.
