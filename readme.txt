(http://tap.tibco.com/storefront/trialware/tibco-activematrix-businessworks-plug-in-for-rest-and-json/prod15308.html)


How to Run this application
First Set The GV of Firebase >> URL to your Instance of Firebase 

You could see two processes: 
1)FireBase 
2)FireBaseWithSchema


To run FireBase , you need to provide the name and text as input and there is no schema used in the file. 
add text and name as input to the starter activity.

You can run FireBaseWithSchema but data wont be available on the chat. But you can view that data in the Forge available at the link https://yaimcrnkl6u.firebaseio-demo.com/# .



If you would like to contribute to this project. you can add other firebase methods like set update and so on as BW process to this project and send us pull request 

Thanks.
